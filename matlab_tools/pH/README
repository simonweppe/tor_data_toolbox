here is a paper on the alkalinity / salinity relationship for the Med (Schneider 2007)

For the Baltic, the paper by MÃ¼ller et al., discussed this in some detail, but it is not so straight forward.

For the open ocean, follow Lee et al., 2006 where you have slightly different relations for different parts of the world.  I am not so sure about the North Sea, but I guess that can go as North Atlantic.

In summary, it requires a little more work to get a good estimate of the alkalinity from our S data.
